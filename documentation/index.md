# Chapter One: Introduction
## 1.1 Introduction
Since the dawn of time, it’s been the characteristic of mankind to travel for the purpose of hunting, gathering and other basic human needs. Even the first man kind are able to move, but the way we (Homo Sapiens) move much unique from others. Transportation has been a big factor for human civilization. For example, in ancient times Rome become a great empire by the development of the paved roads transport their great army.

In different time peoples use different kind of transportation system, some use animals and others use products of engineering, but now a day, transportation is the root of every aspect of life. The main reason behind every scene of this transport evolution is time. People wants to take time on work than transport, this creates various way of transportation, animals to cars, trains to airplanes.

Since Tena transport route and ticket administration platform give attention to time, we are putting forward a solution for Ethiopia transport system through private transport provider. The platform provides a fast and secure way of managing and forwarding services for both companies and customers.

Main futures included in the platform are
* All in one ticket reservation
* Route management
* Employee administration
* Fleet Management

### 1.1.1 Background
As it is a basic human instinct to travel, mankind has been perfecting the means of transportation for millennia2. From bare feet to the invention of the wheel, from basic carts to complicated magnetic bullet trains. Technology has advanced to the point where we can travel thousands of kilometers in mere hours. The main proponent of this development is mankind’s never-ending quest to make transportation cheaper while at the same time making it time efficient as well as more comfortable.

In the capitalistic society we live in, this has enabled the private sector to make millions, even billions, developing such technology. However, there is still a long road ahead in terms of affordability, access and efficiency.

To understand the effect mobility on the world, the Corona Virus (Covid 19) informed everyone about how important transportation was. Since there are various transportation means, people tend to choose the most convenient one at the time. Therefor customer experience is vital part, because it will dictate how they find the best route to reach their destination with the optimal economic Vs comfort trade off all the while making this process as smooth as possible, as it is in developed nations. Although the transportation sector has come a long way, it still has fundamental problems to overcome in order to be on par with international standards.

### 1.1.2 Statement of problem
The transportation system in Ethiopia has encounter involving many problems. Those problems are a factor of different governmental and individuals. As we tried to mention earlier time is most important thing mankind have, but choosing transport providers and reserving ticket consume time. Example if someone from rural area wants to reserve ticket, he/she has to move nearest city with ticket office. In addition to time, availability is another major problem for customers. This can be described in two ways, first in-terms of ticket offices, since transport companies are not able to create ticket offices in every town of Ethiopia, there will be imbalance between individuals. The second one is availability of infrastructure cars, roads and many more, but it is not in the scope of the project. Even though people have enough time do tasks in the current system, they required to have more money depends on where they live. In the worst case they have to have more money, for reservation and travel. As developing country, we believe those problems can be solved using modern technologies.

### 1.1.3 Purpose of the project
The purpose of the project is to provide fast, secure and safe way to administrate route, time and money saving method of ticket reservation. Also, this project tightly tries to balance the difference between class of citizen of Ethiopia by providing easy to use, attainable quality products.

## 1.3 Objective of the project
### 1.3.1 General objective
General objective of the project is to create dynamic web-based transport administration platform. Tena aims to create integrated environment throughout the transport providers also centralized database to customers, which helps to access all providers route data in one place and reserve tickets from anywhere.

### 1.3.2 Specific objective
The following objectives are auxiliary for general objective of the platform

* Realize the current system
* Defining foundation of data for the project
* Select implementation tools according to project requirements
* Design and analyze system architecture and database
* Reveal the working model of platform.
* Implement conferring to requirements using selected implementation tools
* Test the platform
* Deploy the platform

## 1.4 Feasibility
According to our analysis, the project has high probability of feasibility. Let’s describe the project feasibility in detail.

### 1.4.1 Technical feasibility
During our analysis we take two things in our consideration
* Whether the required technology is available or not
* Whether the required resources are available or not?  

Since we are developing dynamic web platform, we are almost out of problem in availability of the technology. Today nearly all general-purpose programming languages have web framework. Also, integration of website to power full database is easy.
Even if web development is required technical resources like knowledge, it is available thorough out learning without any payment. This makes our project technically feasible.

### 1.4.2 Operational feasibility
Relative to technical feasibility operational feasibility may be less, but it does not mean unachievable. While we are analyzing operational feasibility we mainly concerned about deployment and operating of the project.
As a result, we are guaranteed that, the project can be deployed from Ethiopia using PaaS (Platform as a Service) or using on-premises deployment strategies.
On operating side, it is feasible, because it doesn’t require detail knowledge about the technologies. In addition, anyone, who have access internet can operate the platform easily. Due to such factors the project is considered to be operationally feasible.

### 1.4.3 Economical feasibility
Using this platform makes both customers and transport providers economically feasible as a result of the following platform features.
* Save extra money, which is wasted when a customer wants to buy a single ticket
* Make transport providers more productive, since the

platform gives fast online services, and also, increase companies service throughout the country.

### 1.4.4 Budget feasibility
Although we are in start-up, the project can be feasible economically. Due to the following properties of the project.
* Since its implementation does not need extra resources, the project can be built in open-source materials safely and securely.
* Because the existing system has been common for a long time of period throughout the country, it is easy to collecting requirements.

Those scenarios make the project achievable from our budget.

### 1.4.5 Schedule feasibility
Since we are full time student, we are giving our attention to projects and school activities. We are checking our project schedule feasibility from two points, scope of project and schedule of team member individuals.
We analyze the project as schedule feasible because team members are punctual, motivated and interested in the project. Also, the project use small scope specifically private transport providers, so it can be done with in schedule, unless unexpected event occur.

### 1.4.6 Market feasibility
Out market feasibility analysis depends of the following factor
* Current marketing system
* Payment integration

From the above points we can validate the project. From existing system, since it is manual the project can easily competitive in the market, also technology is being used in the country having online market is great idea. Although Ethiopia does not have many online payment methods, but there are still available integration tools to be competitive in the market.

## 1.5 Scope and limitation
### 1.5.1 Scope
At this stage, first version of the project our scope is limited. Since the project can scale up, the scope may change from the first time.
The scope of the project is mainly to concerns part of community whose work is dependent on transportation. Also, we are including this private transport providers as a company in our scope.
In the platform scope is limited to the following tasks
    • Taking transaction online payment thought Ethiopian banks.
    • Display static data using graph.
    • Managing operations of employees
    • Providing digital receipt for customers
    • Providing multiple choice of districts (route) for the customers
    • Reserve tickers online
    • Defining and Manipulating routes
    • Accepting appointments for different time and days.
    • Notifying customers before travel
    • Providing customer profile to transport providers

### 1.5.2 Limitation
* Does not provide total employee management system
* Public transport providers are not included in the platform
* Since the platform is online it required internet connection
* It requires continues electrical power supply for ticket offices
* People in Ethiopia has not experienced of online transactions
* Customer may require to have same basic website app user experience.


## 1.6 Significance of the project
Tena transportation route and ticket administration platform has the following major significance

* By making transaction online the project aim to help in the growth of Ethiopia economy and online payment systems
* Balance transport system by creating competition between transport providers.
* Organize travel records for customers.
* Reserving ticket for customers whenever available and where ever they are using their smart phone.
* Because the system notifies travelers earlier, decrease customers chance of missing their buses.
* Since platform has centralized database, and also connected to internet, customers can check their status using simple but secure authentication system.
* Transport provider can control their employee status in every ticket office.
* Reduce paper work and data loose by providing digital receipt through SMS.
* Allow creating different schedule for routes, also accept appointments from customer.
* Providing data visualization for transport providers and customers.
* Allow other developers to create other system by providing integrations tools for this platform.
* Decreasing time and many wastes by making system available online as much as possible.
* Expanding transport providers business by increasing availability thorough out the country.
* Increasing customers satisfaction by making the platform more interactive both with transport providers and developers.
* Fixing non transport issues like corruption by specifically collecting and providing static and analyzed data.
* Decrease time consumption of the process by gathering and providing all transport providers route data in one place.

## 1.7 Methodology
In this project we have applied the following different methodologies in different parts of project phase

### 1.7.1 Data source
The platform gathers information mainly from customers and transport providers to manipulate and function properly.


### 1.7.2 Fact finding methodologies
for this project, we have chosen the following methods to attain data.
* User observation
* Brain storming

### 1.7.3 System development methodology
In this project we follow V-shaped software process model because
* It is easy to use
* The project needs to be tested every time.
* Since it contains new ideas, that may create release frequently.
* The platform interacts with transactions, we need high reliability.
* Solution and technologies are known.
* Handle changing requirements

# Chapter Two: Current system

## 2.1 Major functionality of the current System
Current system of ticket reservation and administration may be different from one provider to another, but there is basic similarity which makes us to generalize the major functionality of current system.

In the current system customers, they should be presented (represented) in place to take tickets. Which follows the following processes.
* Select one company randomly or repeatedly, which provide transport to targeted destination.
* Although there is a transportation service to their destination, they have to present earlier because of limited number of tickets.
* They will take, paper-based receipt and keep that until they start traveling.
* After having ticket, there must be on time, to travel.

From providers side, they manage their tickets, routes and employees using different manual and digital approaches.

## 2.2 Users of current system

Current system has the following users
* Travelers (Customers)
  * Peoples, whose use public transportation to travel from one place to place.
* Transport providers
  * Companies, that providers transportation to travelers.

## 2.3 Problems of current system
The current system has the following major problems, which affects both customers and transport providers.
In the customers side, major problems are
* Since customers have to do multiple tasks, that require more time. Which is much time wasting.
* In addition to time, money is another resource, which will be consumed more than necessary.
* Even if, customers have enough time and money to reserve ticket, there is low chance of getting tickets.

In the transport providers side, the following points are major problems
* Inefficiency, since it is manipulated by ticket offices, not by every individual, which makes the system slower, that cause inefficiency.
* Unavailability is another problem for providers, that caused as result of limited number of ticket offices in specific city.
* Organization of data is not main concern.
* Some of the major problems of the system is corruption let’s look the following case. Employees in ticket office reserve for the first 5 to 10 tickets, and hide from customers. At the mean time when late customer come to reserve ticket, they sold reserved tickets with additional payment, which is not aim of a company.

## 2.4 Business role of the system
In the use of platform, we have the succeeding business rules
* Transport companies should register in the platform.
* Transport companies should create their employee and routes.
*  Customers should register in the platform
* Customers must have an account in any of supported bank.
* Customers should select and made payment explicitly
