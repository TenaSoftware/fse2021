# Chapter One
## 1.1 Introduction
Since the dawn of time, it’s been the characteristic of man kind to travel for
the purpose of hunting, gathering and other basic human needs. Even the
first man kind are able to move, but the way we(Homo Sapiens) move much
unique from others. Transportation has been a big factor for human
civilization. For example, in ancient times Rome become a great empire by
the development of the paved roads t transport their great army.
In different time peoples use different kind of transportation system, some
use animals and others use products of engineering, but now a day
transportation is the root of every aspect of life. The main reason behind
every scene of this transport evolution is time. People wants to take time
on work than transport, this create various way of transportation, animals
to cars, trains to airplanes.

Since Tena transport routine and ticket administration platform give
attention to time, we are putting forward a solution for Ethiopia transport
system through private transport provider. It provides a fast and time
saving way of managing and serving services for both companies and
customers.

Main futures included in the platform are
* All in one ticket reservation
* Route management
* Employee administration
* Fleet Management

### 1.1.1 Background
As it is a basic human instinct to travel, man kind has been perfecting
the means of transportation for millennia. From bare feet to the invention
of the wheel, from basic carts to complicated magnetic bullet trains,
technology has advanced to the point where we can travel thousands of
kilometers in mere hours. The main proponent of this development is man
kind’s never ending quest to make transportation cheaper while at the same
time making it time efficient as well as more comfortable. In the capitalistic
society we live in, this has enabled the private sector to make millions, even
billions, developing such technology. However, if we are to provide fair
transportation for all, there is still a long road ahead in terms of
affordability, access and efficiency.

To understand the effect mobility on the world, the Corona Virus (Covid 19)
informed everyone about how important transportation was. Since there
are various transportation means, people tend to choose the most
convenient one at the time. Therefor customer experience is vital part
because it will dictate how they find the best route to reach their
destination with the optimal economic Vs comfort trade off all the while
making this process as smooth as possible, as it is in developed nations.
Although the transportation sector has come a long way, it still has
fundamental problems to overcome in order to be on par with international
standards.
chapter1.md
### 1.1.2 Statement of problem
The transportation system in Ethiopia has encounter involving many
problems. Those problems are a factor of different governmental and
individuals. As we tried to mention earlier time is most important thing man
kinds have, but choosing transport providers and reserving ticket consume
time. Example if some one from rural area wants to reserve ticket he/she
has to move nearest city with ticket office. In addition to time availability is
another major problem for customers. This can be described as to ways,
first ticket office, since transport companies can’t create ticket office in
every town of Ethiopia, there will be incompetency between individuals.
The second one is availability of infrastructure which is not in the scope of this project. Even though people have enough time do staffs in the current
system, they required to have more money depends on where they live. In
in the worst case the have to do it twice one for reservation and another for travel. As developing country, we believe those problems are solvable using
modern technologies.

### 1.1.3 Purpose of the project
The purpose of the project is to provide secure and safe way to administrate
route, fast and money saving method of ticket reservation. Also this project
tightly tries to balance the difference between class of man kid’s by
providing easy to use, attainable quality products.

## 1.3 Objective of the project
### 1.3.1 General objective
The general objective of the project is to create dynamic web based
transport administration platform. Tena aims to create integrated
environment through out the transport providers also centralized date to
customers.

### 1.3.2 Specific objective
* Designing expertise user experience and user interface
* Providing light weight web application platform
* Creating centralized database for transport providers
* Manipulating specific route in a specific transport provider
* Providing integration tools for other developers
* Decreasing time and many waste by making system available online as much as possible
* Expanding transport providers business by increasing availability thorough out the country
* Increasing customers satisfaction by making the platform more interactive both with transport providers and developers
* Fixing non transport issues like corruption by specifically collecting and providing static and analyzed data.

## 1.4 Feasibility
According to our analysis, the project has high probability of feasibility. Let’s describe the project feasibility in detail.

### 1.4.1 Technical feasibility
During our analysis we take two things in our consideration
* Whether the required technology is available or not?
* Whether the required resources are available or not?

Since we are developing dynamic web platform, we are out of problem in availability of the technology. Today nearly all general purpose programming languages have web framework. Also integration of website to power full database is easy.

Even if web development is required technical resources like knowledge it is available thorough out learning with out any payment.

### 1.4.2 Operational feasibility
Relative to technical feasibility operational feasibility may be less, but it does not mean achievable. While we are analyzing operational feasibility we mainly concerned about deployment and operating of the project.

As a result we are guaranteed that, the project can be deployed from Ethiopia using PaaS (Platform as a Service) even using on-premises. On operating side it is feasible due to the following factors.
* The platform reduce operational time that consume during paper based system.
* Customers can provide their ideas or complains freely.
* The project benefits the company by making competitive .
* Customers many not have to move long way to check and reserve ticket for different transport providers.
* Through the feedback of customers transport providers able to manage there price.

Due to such factors the project is considered to be operationally feasible.

### 1.4.3 Economical feasibility
Although we are in start up, the project can be feasible economically. Due to the following properties of the project.
* Since it implementation does not need more resources , the project can be built in open-source materials safely and securely.
* Because the existing system has been common for a long time of period through out the country, it is easy to collecting requirements.

Those scenarios are validated from our budget.

### 1.4.4 Schedule feasibility
Since we are full time student we are giving our attention to projects and school activities. We are checking our project schedule feasibility from two points, scope of project and schedule of project team member individuals. We analyze the project as schedule feasible because team members are punctual and motivated and experienced in work. Also the project use small scope specifically private transport providers it can be run in schedule, unless different world wide problems occur.

### 1.4.5 Market feasibility
Out market feasibility analysis depends of the following factor
* Current marketing system
* Payment integration

From the above points we can validate the project. From existing system, since it is manual the project can easily competitive in the market, also technology is being used in the country having online market is great idea. Although Ethiopia does not varieties online payment methods, there is still available integration tools to be competitive in the market.

## 1.5 Scope and limitation
### 1.5.1 Scope
At this stage, first version of the project our scope is limited. Since the project is scalable, the scope may change for next time. The scope of the project is mainly to concerns part of community whose work is dependent on transportation. Also we are including this private transport providers as a companies in our scope. In the platform scope is limited to the following tasks
* Allow user authentication.
* Taking transaction online payment thought Ethiopian banks.
* Static display of data using graph and maps.
* Making CRUD operation on employees
* Providing digital receipt for customers
* Replacing paper based ticket reservation on ticket offices
* Defining and Manipulating routes
* Accepting appointments for different time and days.
* Providing clear data and for choosing from routes
* Reserving ticket online
* Notifying customers before travel
* Providing customer profile to transport providers

### 1.5.2 Limitation
* Since the platform is online it required internet connection
* People in Ethiopia has not experiences of online transactions
* Customer may required to have same basic website app user
experience.

## 1.6 Significance of the project
Tena transportation and ticket administration platform has the following major significance
* By making transaction online the project help’s in the growth of Ethiopia economy and online payment systems
* Balance transport system by creating competition between transport providers.
* Customers check their travel record in an organized way.
* Customers can reserve ticket whenever available and where ever they are using their smart phone on browser.
* Because the system notify travelers earlier, decrease customers chance of missing their buses.
* Since platform has centralized database, and also connected to internet, customers can check their status using simple but secure authentication system.
* Transport provider can control their employee status in every ticket office.
* Reduce paper work and data loose by providing digital receipt through SMS.
* Allow creating different schedule for routes, also accept appointments from customer.
* Handle simple and complex routes.
* Providing data visualization for transport providers and customers.

## 1.7 Methodology
In this project we have applied the following different methodologies in different parts of project phase.

### 1.7.1 Data source
The platform gather information mainly from customers and transport providers to manipulate and function properly.

### 1.7.2 Fact finding methodologies
for this project, we have chosen the following methods to attain data.
* User observation
* Brain storming

### 1.7.3 System development methodology
In this project we follow spiral software process model because
* The project cover large sector.
* Since it contains new ideas, that may creates release frequently.
* The platform interact with transactions, we need to analyze risk in
each steps.
